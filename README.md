Hello! 
I am Priya Singh and my project provides a platform for users to calculate travel time and fuel needs, including top vehicle selection, comparison and customer-friendly design.

In this project, one can enter any real number value for distance and calculate the time and fuel needed for the journey. If the maximum range is exceeded, a warning in red appears.
An additional feature allows users to select a vehicle and view its details along with an image.

There is also a "compare all" feature where the current vehicle is highlighted, and a list of time and fuel values for comparison is shown side by side.

The theme is eye-catching, with aesthetic colors used, and the user experience is ensured to be excellent. Everything is well placed, and the site is easy to use.

Additionally, it is very important that the website is made responsive using media queries, ensuring it looks very good on mobile phones as well since the number of mobile users is vast.
